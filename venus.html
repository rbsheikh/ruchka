<center><h3>Venus</h3>
<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible 
to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the 
west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.
